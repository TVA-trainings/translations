## Working at height and lifting operations

Paragraph  
```
Only use accepted equipment for lifting and only people with a permit can perform lifting.
Lifting equipment must be inspected visually every time before a trained banksman attaches the load and also formal inspection of all the equipment once a year. 
Never lift a load over people and area needs to be isolated so that there is no one in the lifting zone.
```

Error: `... and also formal inspection of all the equipment once a year (should be conducted)`


Paragraph **Conclusions**  
``` The hierarchy of fall protection is a systematic approach to identifying and controlling fall hazards. By prioritizing fall elimination and substitution, then engineering controls, administrative controls, and finally PPE, employers can create a safer work environment for their employees. It is critical to assess each situation individually and choose the most effective and feasible fall protection method based on the task, work environment, and available resources. Ultimately, a combination of methods, rather than relying solely on PPE, is the best way to minimize the risk of falls and enhance worker safety. ```

Error: `... By prioritizing fall elimination and substitution, ...` - like it's substituting fall hazards?

Proposed fix:  
```The hierarchy of fall protection provides a structured approach to identifying and managing fall hazards. By first prioritizing elimination and substitution, followed by engineering controls, administrative measures, and finally personal protective equipment (PPE), employers can create a safer workplace for their employees. It is essential to evaluate each situation individually and select the most effective and practical fall protection method based on the specific task, work environment, and available resources. Ultimately, combining multiple methods—rather than relying solely on PPE—is the most effective way to reduce the risk of falls and improve worker safety. ```
