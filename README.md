## Shared workplace and site induction

In the test there is a question:  
```
Contractors are responsible for their own equipment service and maintenance inspections
```
But the thing is - we haven't mentoined this aspect in the lesson about shared workplace.

In the last paragraph, about contractor, we should add somethinhg like: `Contractors are responsible for their own equipment service and maintenance inspections`.
It's here: https://tva.fi/lms30/lesson/shared-workplace-and-site-induction/ - check also version in the course for plastic card.

## Legislations

In the test there is a question:  
```
Occupational health care investigates work conditions in order to prevent work related illnesses
```
It is not mentoined in the course, it is suprising for me that the answear is TRUE.  
It should be clarified in the lesson about legislations: https://tva.fi/lms30/lesson/legislation/

 fik: add to pl: add to pl: `They interview the employer and survey their working conditions and most typical work tasks related to their industry.`

## Working at height and lifting operations

Paragraph  
```
Only use accepted equipment for lifting and only people with a permit can perform lifting.
Lifting equipment must be inspected visually every time before a trained banksman attaches the load and also formal inspection of all the equipment once a year. 
Never lift a load over people and area needs to be isolated so that there is no one in the lifting zone.
```

Error: `... and also formal inspection of all the equipment once a year (should be conducted)`

FIX:
`Lifting equipment must be inspected visually every time before a trained banksman attaches the load. Formal inspection of all the equipment should be also done once a year.`


Paragraph **Conclusions**  
``` The hierarchy of fall protection is a systematic approach to identifying and controlling fall hazards. By prioritizing fall elimination and substitution, then engineering controls, administrative controls, and finally PPE, employers can create a safer work environment for their employees. It is critical to assess each situation individually and choose the most effective and feasible fall protection method based on the task, work environment, and available resources. Ultimately, a combination of methods, rather than relying solely on PPE, is the best way to minimize the risk of falls and enhance worker safety. ```

Error: `... By prioritizing fall elimination and substitution, ...` - like it's substituting fall hazards?

Proposed fix:  
```The hierarchy of fall protection provides a structured approach to identifying and managing fall hazards. By first prioritizing elimination and substitution, followed by engineering controls, administrative measures, and finally personal protective equipment (PPE), employers can create a safer workplace for their employees. It is essential to evaluate each situation individually and select the most effective and practical fall protection method based on the specific task, work environment, and available resources. Ultimately, combining multiple methods—rather than relying solely on PPE—is the most effective way to reduce the risk of falls and improve worker safety. ```

## Chemicals and ATEX areas

Paragraph  
`In case chemical is transferred from a bigger container into a smaller container, we must ensure that we also mark the smaller container correctly and never place any chemicals into drinking bottles!` while the common practice is to transfer from bigger to smaller, to keep the sentence clear we could reduce it to `In case chemical is transferred to other container, we must ensure that we also mark the new container correctly`.  
And then something like `NEVER place any chemicals into drinking bottles!` should be as another sentence imho.  
 
Take look at **The explosion protection document should include** at the end.

## Weather conditions
Replace the local video with YT (use custom HTML rather that YouTube embed function because custom html allows to set size of embeded frame):
